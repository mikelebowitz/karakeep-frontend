# Karakeep Web Front End Project Status Report

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** July 17, 2025

---

## Project Summary

Develop a productivity-focused web front end for Karakeep using React and React-Admin, connecting to the Karakeep REST API. The primary goal is to provide a fast, intuitive, and accessible interface for managing bookmarks, tags, and lists via rapid CRUD and power-user features like batch actions and real-time search. Deployment via Vercel and a maintainable codebase are key objectives.

*   **Current Status:** Active development - Major UI fixes completed, BookmarkEdit functional, ready for triage mode implementation
*   **Timeline:** Project progressing well. Core functionality stable, focusing on power-user features and triage mode in next phase.

## Critical Issues & Priorities

### Priority 1: Documentation & Code Organization (HIGH)
*   **Clean up and organize documentation:** Consolidate scattered documentation files into organized structure
*   **Update edit screen styling:** Modernize BookmarkEdit form to match current DaisyUI design system
*   **Bring back tag and list views:** Re-enable Tag and List management screens (currently disabled in App.tsx)

### Priority 2: UX & Functionality Improvements (MEDIUM)  
*   **Fix command key behavior in triage mode:** Address keyboard shortcut issues in triage interface
*   **Create clear color palette:** Define consistent colors across the application for better visual hierarchy
*   **Enable bulk editing in list and tag views:** Add batch operations for managing multiple tags/lists at once
*   **Back Button:** Add back button to edit form for better navigation

### Priority 3: Performance & Infrastructure (LOW)
*   **Loading States:** Improve loading indicators and error handling
*   **Performance:** Optimize for large bookmark collections

## Testing Status

*   **Unit Tests:** Not Started - No test framework configured yet
*   **Integration Tests:** Not Started - API integration needs testing
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Not Started - User flows need coverage
*   **Manual Testing/QA:** In Progress - Regular testing of CRUD operations, edit form validation complete
*   **Open Bugs:** 1 minor issue - Back button missing in edit form
*   **Overall Quality Assessment:** Stable for core features, ready for triage mode implementation

## Risks and Issues

*   **Risk/Issue:** Responsive design issues affecting mobile usability
    *   **Impact:** Poor user experience on mobile devices, potential user abandonment
    *   **Mitigation/Plan:** Prioritize responsive table redesign, implement mobile-first approach
    *   **Status:** Resolved - Responsive design fixes implemented, table optimized for various screen sizes

*   **Risk/Issue:** BookmarkEdit form not functioning properly
    *   **Impact:** Users cannot modify bookmark data, limiting core functionality
    *   **Mitigation/Plan:** Fix field mappings, implement custom components for tags/lists
    *   **Status:** Resolved - Edit form fully functional with proper field population and custom components

*   **Risk/Issue:** Missing power-user features for rapid categorization
    *   **Impact:** Differentiation from competitors, user productivity limited
    *   **Mitigation/Plan:** Implement triage mode with keyboard shortcuts for rapid list assignment
    *   **Status:** In Progress - Specification complete, ready for implementation

## Technical Debt & Future Enhancements

*   **DaisyUI Migration:** Recently transitioned from Material-UI to DaisyUI, may need theme refinements
*   **Testing Framework:** Need to add comprehensive testing (Jest, React Testing Library, E2E)
*   **Performance Optimization:** Large bookmark lists may need virtualization
*   **Accessibility Audit:** Full WCAG compliance review needed
*   **API Optimization:** Consider GraphQL for better data fetching
*   **Documentation Cleanup:** Multiple DEVELOPMENT_STATUS_PHASE*.md files need consolidation; docs scattered across directories
*   **Code Organization:** Some features disabled in App.tsx (tags/lists views) need re-enabling
*   **Design System:** Need clear color palette and consistent styling across edit forms
