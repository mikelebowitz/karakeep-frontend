## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a modern, productivity-focused web frontend application for the Karakeep bookmark management system. This application will provide users with an efficient interface to interact with their bookmark data stored and managed via the Karakeep REST API, focusing on speed, usability, and advanced workflow support.

### 2.2 Goals
The primary goals for the Karakeep Web Frontend are:
*   To provide comprehensive Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) capabilities for bookmarks, tags, and lists.
*   To enable power-user workflows through features like batch actions, inline editing, and real-time search/filtering.
*   To implement secure user authentication via the Karakeep API's JWT mechanism.
*   To deliver a highly usable and accessible interface with strong keyboard navigation support.
*   To build a maintainable and extensible codebase utilizing the React-Admin framework and Material UI.
*   To establish a streamlined local development environment and easy deployment process, specifically targeting Vercel.

### 2.3 Target Users
The target users are existing and future Karakeep users who need a robust web interface for managing their collected links and information. This includes users who:
*   Manage large volumes of bookmarks.
*   Require efficient tools for organizing, categorizing (tagging and listing), and retrieving information.
*   Value speed, keyboard navigability, and a streamlined user experience for productivity tasks.
*   May have accessibility needs requiring adherence to web standards.

## 3. Functional Requirements

This section details the core features and functionalities required for the Karakeep Web Frontend.

### 3.1 Authentication & User Management
*   **FR 3.1.1: User Login:** Users must be able to log in using credentials (e.g., username/email and password) provided to the Karakeep REST API.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A dedicated login screen is presented upon first access or after logout/session expiry.
        *   Users can enter their credentials.
        *   Upon successful authentication via the API, a JWT token is received.
        *   The JWT token is securely stored locally (e.g., `localStorage` or equivalent).
        *   The user is redirected to the main application view upon successful login.
        *   An appropriate error message is displayed for invalid credentials or API errors.
*   **FR 3.1.2: Token-Based Session Management:** The application must use the stored JWT token for all subsequent API requests requiring authentication.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Authenticated API requests include the JWT in the `Authorization` header.
        *   The application remains logged in as long as the token is valid and present locally.
        *   Requests with an invalid or expired token are handled gracefully (e.g., display error, prompt re-login).
*   **FR 3.1.3: User Logout:** Users must be able to log out of the application.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A clear "Logout" option is available in the user interface.
        *   Clicking logout removes the locally stored JWT token.
        *   The user is redirected back to the login screen after logout.
        *   Subsequent attempts to access protected resources require re-authentication.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance
*   **NFR 4.1.1: Loading Time:** Initial application load time should be minimized.
    *   **Requirement:** Initial load time should ideally be under 3 seconds on a standard broadband connection.
*   **NFR 4.1.2: UI Responsiveness:** User interface interactions (e.g., button clicks, search filtering, inline edits) should feel instantaneous.
    *   **Requirement:** UI updates following user actions should typically occur within 100-200 milliseconds.
*   **NFR 4.1.3: Data Handling:** The application must efficiently handle listing and searching potentially large numbers of bookmarks (e.g., thousands).
    *   **Requirement:** Bookmark lists should load and filter smoothly even with several thousand entries, leveraging pagination or virtualisation where necessary.

### 4.2 Security
*   **NFR 4.2.1: Authentication Security:** The handling of JWT tokens must be secure.
    *   **Requirement:** JWT tokens must be stored securely (e.g., `localStorage` is acceptable for this application based on standard practices for SPAs, but consideration for XSS risks is needed, potentially mitigating with httpOnly cookies if feasible with the API, though less common for pure JS frontends). All communication with the API must occur over HTTPS.
*   **NFR 4.2.2: Input Sanitization:** Frontend input fields should perform basic sanitization to prevent common vulnerabilities.
    *   **Requirement:** User input displayed in the UI should be properly escaped or sanitized to prevent XSS attacks. (Note: API-side sanitization is also critical).

### 4.3 Technical Requirements
*   **NFR 4.3.1: Technology Stack:**
    *   **Requirement:** The application must be built using React, leveraging the React-Admin framework and Material UI for UI components.
*   **NFR 4.3.2: Code Maintainability:** The codebase must be well-structured, documented, and follow standard coding practices.
    *   **Requirement:** Code should adhere to established style guides (e.g., Airbnb, StandardJS), include appropriate comments, and have a logical component structure. Unit and integration tests should be implemented for critical components/workflows.
*   **NFR 4.3.3: Extensibility:** The architecture should allow for relatively easy addition of new features or management of new entity types in the future.
    *   **Requirement:** Utilize React-Admin's conventions for resources, data providers, and custom components to facilitate future expansion.
*   **NFR 4.3.4: Local Development:** A simple and quick local development environment setup is required.
    *   **Requirement:** The project should include clear instructions (e.g., `README.md`) and configuration files (`package.json`) allowing developers to clone the repository and start the application with minimal steps (`npm install`, `npm start` or similar). Environment variables should be used for API endpoints and keys.
*   **NFR 4.3.5: Deployment:** The application must be deployable to Vercel.
    *   **Requirement:** The project structure and build process must be compatible with Vercel's requirements for automatic builds and deployments from a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). Configuration for environment variables on Vercel should be straightforward.

## 5. Dependencies and Constraints

### 5.1 Dependencies
*   **Karakeep REST API:** The application is entirely dependent on the availability, stability, performance, and correct functioning of the Karakeep REST API for all data operations (CRUD for bookmarks, tags, lists) and authentication. The API must provide well-defined endpoints following REST principles and return data in a format consumable by React-Admin (typically JSON, often requiring adaptation via a custom `dataProvider`).
*   **React-Admin Library:** The project relies heavily on the React-Admin framework for core administrative interface components and patterns. Functionality is constrained by React-Admin's capabilities and extensibility points.
*   **Material UI Library:** The project utilizes Material UI for styling and standard UI components. The look and feel will largely follow Material Design principles.
*   **Modern Web Browsers:** The application is dependent on modern web browser capabilities (e.g., Fetch API, ES6+ features, CSS Grid/Flexbox). Specific browser support matrix needs to be defined (e.g., latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

### 5.2 Constraints
*   **Scope:** The project is strictly limited to the development of the web frontend application. No changes to the Karakeep REST API are included in this scope.
*   **Framework Adoption:** The project is constrained to using React-Admin and Material UI. Significant deviations or implementation of features that fight against these frameworks' paradigms should be avoided where possible.
*   **API Data Shape:** The frontend must adapt to the data structures provided by the Karakeep API. If the API's response format does not directly match React-Admin's expectations, a significant effort may be required in the `dataProvider` layer.

## 6. Risk Assessment

*   **Risk 6.1: Karakeep API Instability or Lack of Documentation:**
    *   **Description:** The Karakeep REST API is unstable, endpoints change unexpectedly, or documentation is incomplete/inaccurate.
    *   **Impact:** Significant delays in frontend development, incorrect feature implementation, difficulty debugging, potential for broken features post-deployment.
    *   **Mitigation:** Establish close communication channels with the API development team. Request clear, stable API documentation early. Implement robust error handling and graceful degradation in the frontend when API calls fail. Prioritize development based on the most stable API endpoints.
*   **Risk 6.2: Performance Bottlenecks with Large Datasets:**
    *   **Description:** The application becomes slow or unresponsive when managing thousands of bookmarks due to inefficient data fetching, processing, or rendering.
    *   **Impact:** Poor user experience, frustration for power users, failure to meet performance non-functional requirements.
    *   **Mitigation:** Design data fetching with pagination or infinite scrolling from the start. Ensure the API supports server-side filtering, sorting, and searching. Utilize React-Admin features or custom components optimised for large lists (e.g., virtualization). Profile performance early and iteratively.
*   **Risk 6.3: Difficulty Implementing Power Features with React-Admin:**
    *   **Description:** Implementing advanced features like real-time search, complex batch actions, or specific inline editing behaviors proves difficult or requires significant overrides within the React-Admin framework.
    *   **Impact:** Increased development time, potential for hacky or less maintainable code, features may not meet the desired level of polish or functionality.
    *   **Mitigation:** Conduct a thorough spike/evaluation early in the project to assess React-Admin's flexibility for the required power features. Leverage React-Admin's customization options (`<Input>`, `<Field>`, custom actions, etc.). Be prepared to build custom React components outside of strict React-Admin conventions where necessary, integrating them carefully.
*   **Risk 6.4: Ensuring High Accessibility Standards:**
    *   **Description:** Achieving WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across the entire application proves challenging, especially with a framework like React-Admin/Material UI which may require custom component work or specific configurations for accessibility.
    *   **Impact:** Excludes users with disabilities, potential legal or compliance issues, negative impact on user perception.
    *   **Mitigation:** Integrate accessibility considerations from the design phase. Use semantic HTML. Regularly employ automated accessibility testing tools (e.g., Lighthouse, axe-core) throughout development. Conduct manual keyboard navigation testing and screen reader testing. Consult accessibility guidelines and experts if needed. Prioritize fixing accessibility issues as they are identified.
