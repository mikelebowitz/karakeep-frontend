# Karakeep Frontend (Experimental UI)

> **Note**: This is an experimental user interface for the Karakeep bookmark management system. I think Karakeep is an excellent project with a well-designed API, and this experimental UI explores what a modern React-based frontend could look like for it.

## 🎨 UI Components

The app uses DaisyUI components with custom Karakeep themes:

- **karakeep**: Light theme with blue primary colors
- **karakeep-dark**: Dark theme variant

### Key UI Features

- Responsive drawer layout with sidebar navigation
- Card-based bookmark display
- Form handling with validation
- Loading states and error handling
- Mobile-optimized interface

## 🔗 API Integration

The frontend integrates seamlessly with the Karakeep REST API:

- **Data Provider**: Custom implementation with cursor-based pagination
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with API token support (`ak1_*` format)
- **Smart Endpoints**: Automatic selection of optimal API endpoints
- **Resources**: Full CRUD for bookmarks, tags, and lists
- **Client-Side Filtering**: Handles complex filter combinations locally

### Available Routes

- `/bookmarks` - Bookmark listing with advanced filtering and bulk selection
- `/bookmarks/show/:id` - Bookmark detail view
- `/bookmarks/edit/:id` - Bookmark editing form
- `/bookmarks/create` - New bookmark creation

## 🎯 Key Features

### Advanced Search & Filtering
The bookmark list includes a professional-grade filtering system:
- **Instant Search**: Debounced search with Cmd+K shortcut
- **Tag Filtering**: Multi-select tags with removable badges
- **List Filtering**: Multi-select lists with visual indicators
- **Special Filters**: Find untagged or unlisted bookmarks quickly
- **Smart API Usage**: Automatically selects optimal endpoints for performance

### Two-Tier Bulk Selection
Enterprise-ready bulk operations with two selection modes:
- **Visible Selection**: Traditional checkbox selection (Cmd+A)
- **All Matching Selection**: Select all results across pages (Cmd+Shift+A)
- **Visual Indicators**: Warning badges and tooltips for clarity
- **Bulk Actions Toast**: Contextual actions with keyboard hints

### Professional Keyboard Navigation
Complete keyboard control for power users:
- `Cmd+K` - Focus search instantly
- `Cmd+A` - Select all visible items
- `Cmd+Shift+A` - Select all matching results
- `Cmd+D` - Deselect everything
- `ESC` - Context-aware clearing (modal → selections → focus)
- Arrow keys for table navigation
- `Space` to toggle selection
- `Enter` to open triage modal

## 📋 Current Status

This project was successfully migrated from React-Admin to Refine for better performance and maintainability.

### ✅ Completed
